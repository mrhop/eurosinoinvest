            <h5>Where we come from</h5>

            <p>
                Fifteen years ago our CEO Florian Schmied traveled to China to establish the company Euro Sino Invest.
                The company has grown and is the biggest European Real estate project developer in the Asian market by
                now. In China, ESI has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong and Shenyang.
                Currently the Asian Photovoltaic market is expected to make a development as fast as the real estate
                market has done before. To jump at the chance, in April 2013 the company Desert Solar Power DSP was
                founded.
            </p>
            <h5>What we do</h5>

            <p>
                We are an international active project developer all around the topic Photovoltaics. Because of our
                outstanding connections to political and administrative decision makers worldwide, we have specialized
                on challenging markets. We do the conversations with all relevant stakeholders - from politicians,
                officials, financiers to EPC /- and O&M – contractors. Among other things we obtain all necessary
                approvals and licenses and arrange the acquisition of the building site.
            </p>
            <h5>What we place value on</h5>

            <p>
                We have the corporate opinion that in times of the climate change and the scarcity of resources the
                generation of electricity out of renewable sources displays the main solution. For us, sustainability
                does not just mean the generation of clean electricity, there are two other important parameters. For
                example we always try to employ as many local workers as possible during the building- and the operation
                -phase to locally create a social added value in the respective country. Further all of the projects we
                are responsible for are financially very attractive for our finance partners. Our team, which gives
                support to all of our projects from the first idea to the recycling of the modules, guarantees a
                successful project.
            </p>
            <h5>Where we want to go to</h5>

            <p>
                Our CEO Florian Schmied is also the CEO of Euro Sino Invest ESI at the same time, the biggest European
                real estate developer in the Asian region. Following the example set by ESI we want to become the
                biggest European photovoltaic – project developer in the Asian market.
